			<h4>Samples and previous work</h4>
			
			<p>These are the samples I have available at the time of writing:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Mammoth Lakes: various rock and mineral samples from the area around Mammoth Lakes, CA.</li>
				<li>Dotsero: rocks and mineral separates from Dotsero, CO.</li>
				<li>Hawaii: various samples from different islands -- some leftover from grad school and some that heve not been analyzed before.</li>
				<li>Teaching samples: thin section samples "Evan G" and "Jason L" used as demo material for the microprobe class.</li>
				<li>Melt inclusions collection: material leftover from various projects in grad school.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Miscellaneous figures</h4>

					230717 -- Results from analyses of SI standards using WDS (20 kV, 20 nA).  Analyses were done on a mixture of our MAC and SI reference
					materials, and no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the accuracy returned by the WDS analyses.
					
					<b>Figure:</b>  Plots of the reference concentration (X-axis) vs the analyzed concentration (Y-axis) with a 95% prediction envelope
					calculated using R.  Solid red line = linear regression.  Dashed red lines = prediction envelopw.  Solid gray line = 1:1 line.
					
					<b>Table:</b>  Average 95% uncertainty for each element (i.e. a mean value that eliminates curvature in the prediction envelopw going
					away from the median value).  So as an example, an analysis would have plus or minus 0.96 wt% uncertainty for SiO2, which is "baked in"
					as a result of arbitrarily choosing a random mineral standard for the calibration.  This wouls be an argument for using "6 nines pure"
					atandards as recommended by John Donovan.

					241007 -- WDS analyses of reference minerals compared with EDS analyses with standards-based quantification done usnig DTSA-II.  Based
					on these results, I think it's probably fine to do some very basic petrologic calculations using the EDS data.  Temperatures were calculated
					from glass using one of those easy MgO thermometers.  The Fo number range is qoted in John Fournelle's recent (2017?) paper (conference
					abstract?)about San Carlos olivine.

					230509 -- notes from session looking at Quepos grain mount with a few recrystalized melt inclusions.  It seems like I was planning to maybe
					also analyze the Luca Hawaii grain mounts but this didn't happen (examining on 241008, it doesn't look like those were C coated, but I'm
					not totally sure.

			<h4>Progress log</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>240911 -- Full thin section maps of Evan G and Jason L thin sections.</li>
				<li>241005 -- Early start to a weeklong session the following week.  Worked on 20 kV and 15 kV recipes for minerals and glasses
				respectively.  EDS analyses to identify minerals in Evan G map.  WDS quant analyses of Evan G minerals.  Repllicates of SI samples.
				Quant recipes include standards-based calibration for EDS, which can be retrieved through off-qnt.</li>
				<li></li>

			<p><b>Commentary:</b> If I were a good microprobe user, I would have photographed and scanned the sample before starting any analyses,
			but sometimes one is in a hurry and doesn't do that.  The PCA analyses, EDS analyses, and Ti-In-Qtz analyses were done before I went
			back to the Petrology lab to make the photo/scans.</p>
