			<h4>Samples and previous work</h4>
			
			<p>These are the samples I have available at the time of writing:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Mammoth Lakes: various rock and mineral samples from the area around Mammoth Lakes, CA.</li>
				<li>Dotsero: rocks and mineral separates from Dotsero, CO.</li>
				<li>Hawaii: various samples from different islands -- some leftover from grad school and some that heve not been analyzed before.</li>
				<li>Teaching samples: thin section samples "Evan G" and "Jason L" used as demo material for the microprobe class.</li>
				<li>Melt inclusions collection: material leftover from various projects in grad school.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Miscellaneous figures</h4>

					230509 -- notes from session looking at Quepos grain mount with a few recrystalized melt inclusions.  It seems like I was planning to maybe
					also analyze the Luca Hawaii grain mounts but this didn't happen (examining on 241008, it doesn't look like those were C coated, but I'm
					not totally sure.

			<h4>Progress log</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>240911 -- Full thin section maps of Evan G and Jason L thin sections.</li>
				<li>241005 -- Early start to a weeklong session the following week.  Worked on 20 kV and 15 kV recipes for minerals and glasses
				respectively.  EDS analyses to identify minerals in Evan G map.  WDS quant analyses of Evan G minerals.  Repllicates of SI samples.
				Quant recipes include standards-based calibration for EDS, which can be retrieved through off-qnt.</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>TODO</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Upload PCA images</li>
				<li>Link to Probesoftware discussions about DTSA-II</li>
				<li>Link to RiMG69 contents</li>
				<li>Link to mineral formula calculators</li>
			</ul>

			<p><b>Commentary:</b> If I were a good microprobe user, I would have photographed and scanned the sample before starting any analyses,
			but sometimes one is in a hurry and doesn't do that.  The PCA analyses, EDS analyses, and Ti-In-Qtz analyses were done before I went
			back to the Petrology lab to make the photo/scans.</p>
