			<h1>Basic RGB clustering</h1>
			
			<h4>Rev. 2/22/2023 LRM</h4>
			
			<p>Lately I've been trying to wrap my mind around the problem of using multi-channel images of rock samples to segment the analyzed area 
			according to the minerals in the sample.  With one channel, it's a simple thresholding problem.  With two channels, clusters can be identified
			with a scatter plot.  Clusters in three channels can be identified similarly using a ternary plot.  But what about four or more channels?</p>
			
			<p>Here's where one might think about clustering using k-means, HCA, or some other statistical model (ANNs?) for classification.  But more 
			sophisticated models require more sophisticated optimization, so the choice of a fancy clustering model requires demonstrating that it 
			can out-perform a simpler model.</p>
			
			<p>So here's my proposed solution: reduce the dataset to three channels, make an RGB image, and do clustering on the image.  Do I think this is 
			the best solution? No.  Well, yes.  Or maybe?  Consider this like the "null hypothesis" in the sense that we can only accept a more complex solution
			after it can be demonstrated to out-perform my "null solution."  So, yes for now.

			<p>Here's an example image from EDS data collected on a basalt from near Mammoth Lakes, CA.  The red, green, and blue channels correspond to Fe, Mg, 
			and Si respectively.  The image was made in ImageJ by... eh, nevermind.</p>
			
			<p>Ok, so let's use the the best, most readily-available neural network to segment the image: the human brain!  I think I see a green plase, a
			dark blue phase, a light blue phase, and a red phase.  There -- what do I win?</p>
			
			<a href ="../images/basic rgb clustering/Stack (RGB) 2d scatter.bmp"><img src="../images/basic rgb clustering/Stack (RGB) 2d scatter.bmp" alt=""></a>
			
			<p>Ok, so where them clusters at?  Here's a couple of 2d-scatter plots colored as in the image. looks like there is a lot of noise, but the
			data seem to cluster around a few endmember locations, similar to the clusters immediately visible in the image.</p>
			
			<a href ="../images/basic rgb clustering/Stack (RGB) ternary.bmp"><img src="../images/basic rgb clustering/Stack (RGB) ternary.bmp" alt=""></a>
			
			<p>Yes, this is way better: using a ternary plot, the clusters can now be clearly separated on a single image.  Now all I have to do is use my
			locate_poly function to manually identify the points...</p>
			
			<a href ="../images/basic rgb clustering/Stack (RGB) clusters.bmp"><img src="../images/basic rgb clustering/Stack (RGB) clusters.bmp" alt=""></a>
			
			<p>...and here are the clusters!  Note that closters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are unsegmented points, the green phase, a lighter green phase that 
			I identified subsequently, the red phase, the light blue phase, and the dark blue phase respectively.  The number of unclassified points can 
			pretty much be ignored since it doesn't account for very many pixels.</p>
