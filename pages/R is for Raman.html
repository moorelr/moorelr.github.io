			<h1>R is for Raman/h1>
			<h4>Rev. 2/22/2022 LRM</h4>
			
			<p>When I was a grad student, I was involved in a project that used a method called Raman spectroscopy to measure the pressure of gas bubbles trapped in volcanic rocks. To that end, I spent many hours in a dark room collecting hundreds of data files, and many more hours in the same room – now with the lights turned on – processing the data on a lab computer outfitted with special proprietary software. It sucked.</p>
			
			<p>Eventually, I got over the “hump” of learning to use R to process the data on my own. The benefit of using R instead of the proprietary software is that R allowed me to go home and drink beers and process the data from the comfort of my own sofa!</p>
			
			<p>Here’s an example of the spectra I needed to process:</p>

			<p>The panel on the left shows an example of the spectrum plotted in base-R using plot(… type = “l”) for line segments – i.e. as one would expect a spectrum to look. The center panel shows a zoom in on one of the peaks in the spectrum, plotted as points. The panel on the right shows a view of the same peak with the fit overlain with a red line.</p>
			
			<p>Fitting peaks is a fairly straightforward concept. It’s more or less the same as fitting a polynomial to two columns of data (e.g. as one would do in Excel), but with a couple of complications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the function being compared to the data is a combination of two functions, one for a line plus one for a Gaussian peak</li>
				<li>the nonlinear fitting algorithm requires an initial guess for the fit parameters (that’s what is shown in blue in the rightmost panel above.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Here is a figure showing a simple case of a Gaussian peak plus a linear background:</p>
			<img src="../images/Spectrum example.png" alt="">
			
			<p>The R script implements this strategy using the glm() function to fit the nonlinear peak + background, a simple clickable user interface generated with the menu() function, and some while() and try() action for process control. The try() function is necessary because the nonlinear fitting algorithm doesn’t always converge, and the script includes a “wiggle” loop to randomly perturb the initial guess when it doesn’t converge successfully. Working on this script over many iterations, it’s now pretty good at fitting the data without any hangups.</p>
			
			<p>Here is what the interface looks like when the script is running:</p>
			<img src="../images/peak fit menu.png" alt="">
			
			<p>The workflow is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Populate the “data” folder with tab-separated text files without headers. The first column should be energy (i.e. the x-axis), and the second column should be intensity (i.e. the y-axis).</li>
				<li>Run the script with R, and the user menu should appear.</li>
				<li>Click “import spectrum” to load and display the first spectrum.</li>
				<li>Click one of the “...peak” options to try fitting a peak. If the fit is successful, the plot should be updated to display the fit in red, and the peak parameters will be appended to a data frame.</li>
				<li>Repeat step 4) until all desired peaks have been fit.</li>
				<li>Click “Next spectrum” to advance to the next text file in the directory.</li>
				<li>Repeat steps 3) through 6) until all of the spectra have been processed.</li>
				<li>Choose “quit” when you’re done. The script will end by saving the peak parameters into a timestamped .csv file.</li>
			</ol>
