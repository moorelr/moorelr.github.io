			oxalate crystals. These are also called raphides, and are needle sharp and shoot out of damaged parts of the plant. The crystals are 
			insoluble and persistent when they contact tissue. The result is an inflammatory reaction, which can be mild to severe and accompanied by 
			other symptoms.</p>
