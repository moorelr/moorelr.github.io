			<p>[Verse 1]
			<br>Oh, the year was 1778
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>A letter of marque came from the king
			<br>To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen</p>

			<p>[Chorus]
			<br>God damn them all, I was told
			<br>We'd cruise the seas for American gold
			<br>We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
			<br>Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
			<br>The last of Barrett's privateers</p>

			<p>[Verse 2]
			<br>Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>For twenty brave men, all fishermen, who
			<br>Would make for him the Antelope's crew</p>

			<p>[Verse 3]
			<br>The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
			<br>And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags</p>

			<p>[Verse 4]
			<br>On the King's birthday, we put to sea
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay
			<br>Pumping like madmen all the way</p>

			<p>[Verse 5]
			<br>On the ninety-sixth day, we sailed again
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
			<br>With our cracked four pounders, we made to fight</p>

			<p>[Verse 6]
			<br>The Yankee lay low down with gold
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
			<br>But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days</p>

			<p>[Verse 7]
			<br>Then at length, we stood two cables away
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
			<br>But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in</p>

			<p>[Verse 8]
			<br>The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
			<br>And the main truck carried off both me legs</p>

			<p>[Verse 9]
			<br>So here I lay in my twenty-third year
			<br>How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
			<br>It's been six years since we sailed away
			<br>And I just made Halifax yesterday</p>

			<p>[Chorus]
			<br>Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage
			<br>To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the Beaufort Sea
			<br>Tracing one warm line through a land so wild and savage
			<br>And make a Northwest Passage to the sea</p>

			<p>[Verse 1]
			<br>Westward from the Davis Strait 'tis there 'twas said to lie
			<br>The sea route to the Orient for which so many died
			<br>Seeking gold and glory, leaving weathered, broken bones
			<br>And a long-forgotten lonely cairn of stones</p>

			<p>[Verse 2]
			<br>Three centuries thereafter, I take passage overland
			<br>In the footsteps of brave Kelsey, where his Sea of Flowers began
			<br>Watching cities rise before me, then behind me sink again
			<br>This tardiest explorer, driving hard across the plain</p>

			<p>[Verse 3]
			<br>And through the night, behind the wheel, the mileage clicking west
			<br>I think upon Mackenzie, David Thompson and the rest
			<br>Who cracked the mountain ramparts and did show a path for me
			<br>To race the roaring Fraser to the sea</p>

			<p>[Verse 4]
			<br>How then am I so different from the first men through this way?
			<br>Like them, I left a settled life, I threw it all away
			<br>To seek a Northwest Passage at the call of many men
			<br>To find there but the road back home again</p>

			<p>[Verse 1]
			<br>There once was a ship that put to sea
			<br>The name of the ship was the Billy O' Tea
			<br>The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
			<br>Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)</p>

			<p>[Chorus]
			<br>Soon may the Wellerman come
			<br>To bring us sugar and tea and rum
			<br>One day, when the tonguing is done
			<br>We'll take our leave and go</p>

			<p>[Verse 2]
			<br>She'd not been two weeks from shore
			<br>When down on her a right whale bore
			<br>The captain called all hands and swore
			<br>He'd take that whale in tow (huh)</p>

			<p>Da-da-da-da-da
			<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
			<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da</p>

			<p>[Verse 3]
			<br>Before the boat had hit the water
			<br>The whale's tail came up and caught her
			<br>All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
			<br>When she dived down low (huh)</p>

			<p>[Verse 4]
			<br>No line was cut, no whale was freed
			<br>The captain's mind was not of greed
			<br>And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
			<br>She took that ship in tow (huh)</p>

			<p>Da-da-da-da-da
			<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
			<br>Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da</p>

			<p>[Verse 5]
			<br>For forty days or even more 
			<br>The line went slack then tight once more
			<br>All boats were lost, there were only four
			<br>But still that whale did go (huh)</p>

			<p>[Verse 6]
			<br>As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
			<br>The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
			<br>The Wellerman makes his regular call
			<br>To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)</p>

		<a href = "#contents">back to top</a>
		
			<p>[Verse 1]
			<br>There once was a stock that put to sea
			<br>The name of the stock was GME
			<br>The price blew up and the shorts dipped down
			<br>Hold, my bully boys, hold</p>

			<p>[Chorus]
			<br>Soon may the Tendieman come
			<br>To send our rocket into the Sun
			<br>One day when the trading is done
			<br>We'll take our gains and go</p>

			<p>[Verse 2]
			<br>She had not been two weeks from shore
			<br>When Ryan Cohen joined the board
			<br>The captain called all hands and swore
			<br>He'd take his shares and hold</p>

			<p>[Verse 3]
			<br>Before the news had hit the market
			<br>Wall Street bets came up and bought it
			<br>With diamond hands they knew they'd profit
			<br>If they could only hold</p>

			<p>[Verse 4]
			<br>No deals were cut, no shorts were squeezed
			<br>The captain's mind was not on greed
			<br>But he belonged to the autist's creed
			<br>He took the risk to hold</p>

			<p>[Verse 5]
			<br>For 40 days, or even more
			<br>The stock went up, then down once more
			<br>All gains were lost it was looking poor
			<br>But still those traders did hold</p>

			<p>[Verse 6]
			<br>As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
			<br>The shorts not squeezed and the gains not won
			<br>The Tendieman makes his regular call
			<br>To encourage the captain, crew and all</p>
