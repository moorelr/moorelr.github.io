			<h1>Bris-1 mystery sample</h1>
			<h4>Rev. 12/27/2023 LRM... A test case for microprobe method development for metamorphic petrology applications</h4>
			
			<p>Bris-1 is a random thin section that I found in the Petrology Lab when I started working as a lab manager.  At the time of 
			writing, I have no idea where it comes from.  So far, it's turned out to be a garnet-bearing metamorphic rock with a lot of quartz, 
			alkali feldspars, biotite, and kyanite.</p>
			
			<p><b>Note:</b> I use YYMMDD dates in my notes, and some of these dates may be floating around in here.</p>

			<p><b>Commentary:</b> If I were a good microprobe user, I would have photographed and scanned the sample before starting any analyses,
			but sometimes one is in a hurry and doesn't do that.  The PCA analyses, EDS analyses, and Ti-In-Qtz analyses were done before I went
			back to the Petrology lab to make the photo/scans.</p>

			<p><b>Commentary: </b>A big-picture problem I am interested in figuring out is how to obtain modal mineral abundances using X-ray maps.
			This problem has been solved previously with various image segmentation programs including <a href = "https://xmaptools.ch/">Pierre
			Lanari's XMapTools</a>, but that doesn't prevent me from being curious about strategies for image segmentation or other ways to make
			sense of multi-channel X-ray data.</p>
			
			<p>To get some preliminary X-ray data for the sample, I made a full thin section map using the following settings with the result
			shown below.  I think it was also my intent to use the thin section to test my monazite dating method, but I must have forgotten about
			this initially.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>20 kV, 100 nA beam, defocused to a 20 micron circular spot</li>
				<li>18.060 x 36.580 scan range with 20 micron square pixels</li>
				<li>903 x 1829 pixel resolution x 20 ms dwell time = 10h 26m</li>
				<li>WDS: Mg(TAP), Ca(PET), Ce(PET), Mn(LiF), P(TAP)</li>
				<li>EDS: manually selected major elements, reduced aperture</li>
				<li>IMS: SED, BED-C, PCLI</li>
			</ul>

					180 degrees relative to the thin section photo/scans above.  I have been going back and forth between policies on the
					microprobe that "the label should be at the top" vs "the text on the label should be right side up."  At the time of
					wiriting, the latter is my working policy.

			<p><b>Aside:</b> At some point, I'll probably need to explain what PCA is and how it's being used here.  Here are my notes about PCA:</p>
			
			<h5>Lowell's explanation of PCA</h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The goal of PCA is dimensionality reduction.  Suppose you have a dataset with many dimensions, but some of the variables are
				correlated. In this case, multiple variables can be summarized by simply considering a linear relationship between them.</li>
				<li>In geology, the use of various mineralogical indices calculated from more complete chemical analyses (e.g. Fo#, An#,
				Peralkalinity index) accomplishes the goal of dimensionality reduction, and is loosely analogous to PCA.</li>
				<li>PCA refers to a calculation that projects multidimensional data onto a new coordinate system.</li>
				<li>The axes in the coordinate system are mutually orthogonal, and each axis points in the direction of maximum variance.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>(the "mathy" bits)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The number of PCs is equal to the number of variables</li>
				<li>The PCs are unit vectors that constitute an orthonormal basis</li>
				<li>Note: an eigenvector is a vector "v" corresponding to a square matrix "A" such that the product A*v = lambda*v where
				the scalar "lambda" is the eigenvalue of eigenvector "v"</li>
				<li>Also note: a covariance matrix is an n x n matrix of n variables where each item in the matrix is the covariance of
				two corresponding variables of the variables.</li>
				<li>The PCs are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix.  PCA performs a change of basis calculation to transform the
				original data to be expressed eigenvalues of the PCs/eigenvectors/orthonormal unit vectors.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>(defining some of the jargon)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Loading (positive/negative): refers to the degree to which a variable contributes to or is correlated with a PC</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>Commentary:</b> PCA was done for the Bris-1 sample in R with the image made from PC's 1, 2, and 3 mapped onto the R, G, and B
			channels respectively.  The process of making the PCA image is extremely easy, but interpreting the colors/clusters as individual
			minerals and segmenting the image into the clusters is difficult.</p>
			
			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					A photo of my printed-out-and-written-on notes from a session that I spent trying to "ground truth" the minerals that I had
					previously attempted to identify using my X-ray maps.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>After looking around with the EDS, here are the main takeaways (with colors in reference to the PCA image above):
			<ul>
				<li>The quartz, garnet, and ilmenite seem to have been identified correctly.</li>
				<li>I misidentified the feldspars: the lighter green phase is a Na-rich feldspar (~75% Albite), and the darker green phase is a
				K-rich feldspar (~90% Orthoclase).</li>
				<li>In the patchy red/orange/brown areas that I labeled as "Biotite?" several minerals are present:
				<ul>
					<li>Yellowish-brown = Kyanite</li>
					<li>Dark red = Cordierite</li>
					<li>Light pinkish-red = Biotite</li>
					<li>Darker maroon = also biotite, containing Ti?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Also, it seems like there could be two micas growing together: a more K-rich mica, and a more Fe+Ti-rich mica (biotite and
				muscovite?).</li>
				<li>The light pink/purple color seems to include both monazite and sulfides (pyrrhotite?) as well as ilmenite.</li>
				<li>The white phase marked as "Sulfides?" is actually apatite.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h5>Outstanding questions:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>How do EDS maps compare to my full thin section map?  (need to include some for comparison.</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>

			Segmentation
			==============================================================================-->
			
			<h3>Segmentation</h3>
			
			<p>Here's what I've tried so far with regards to segmentation:
			<ul>
				<li>K-means clustering EDS maps in ImageJ</li>
				<li>"Segmenting" images (to visualize potential clusters) using PCA in R + ImageJ</li>
				<li>K-means clustering EDS maps in R</li>
				<li>Naively segmenting BSE images using the "16 colors" LUT in ImageJ</li>
				<li>Staring at transmitted light photomicrographs wishing that the thin section would just segment itself</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			Trace element method

			<h3>Garnet trace element maps</h3>

				<figcaption>
					Comparison of exploratory WDS spectra vs trace element maps.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p><b>Commentary:</b> most users are unsure about the best conditions to use for mapping trace elements.  Usually the trace element in
			question is Yttrium, and the material in question is garnet.  Ideally, I should be able to provide a general way for the user to figure
			this out independently without wasting a bunch of time trying things randomly, and collecting a few "qualitative" WDS spectra to test
			out different spectrometer/element pairings, dwell times, and beam conditions seems like the best way to do this.  I've written about
			this process elsewhere.</p>
			
			<p>The figure above shows the results of a basic test that I did, which basically determined -- without making any maps ahead of
			time -- that mapping Y, Ti, Sc, and Cr would be a waste of time for this garnet for the amount of time that I was prepared to spend
			doing so.</p>
			
			<h5>Outstanding questions</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Are any other elements zoned in the garnet?</li>
				<li>Are there any other zoned minerals in the sample?</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<!--=============================================================================
			Ti-in-Qtz
			==============================================================================-->
			
			<h3>Ti-in-Qtz</h3>
			
			<p>One method I have been working on is quantifying Ti in quartz, which seems to be a popular thermobarometer these days.  This is
			obviously challenging because one doesn't think of quartz as containing a lot of Ti, but it's also challenging because of some "manual
			labor" that goes into summing the counts collected on multiple spectrometers.</p>
			
			<figure>

					well-characterized quartz "check standard" containing 57 ppm of Ti.

			<h5>Outstanding questions:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>How do the Ti concentrations compare to the CL brightness?
				<li></li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>Monazite dating</h3>
			
			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					Grayscale BSE image of the Bris-1 mystery sample with Ce false color image overlain for ~0.03% of pixels containing the most Ce,

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p><b>Aside:</b> Here is my method formaking the overlay image for future reference:
			<ol>
				<li>Open the "COMPO" and "Ce" maps in ImageJ</li>
				<li>Select the "Ce" image and click "Image > Adjust > Threshold..." to open the thresholding tool</li>
				<li>Choose the pixel range going from some arbitrary minimum value up to the maximum value so that only the most Ce-rich pixels are
				selected, and close the menu without clicking any buttons.  At this point, the chosen pixels should appear red on the image.</li>
				<li>Click "Edit > Selection > Create Selection" to select the hilighted pixels</li>
				<li>Click "Image > Lookup Tables > Fire" to apply a lookup table</li>
				<li>Click "Image > Type > RGB Color" to change the now false color image to RGB format</li>
				<li>Ctrl+C to copy the selected pixels</li>
				<li>Select the "COMPO" image, and click "Image > Type > RGB Color" to change it also to RGB format</li>
				<li>Ctrl+V to paste the selected pixels onto the "COMPO" image</li>
				<li>Zoom in on a bright area and double check that the pasted pixels are in the right location.  Fortunately, you can click and
				drag the pasted pixels if they need to be adjusted.  I suspect that the they will be accurate if the maximum area of the selection
				matches the maximum area of the image, but not if the area is smaller.</li>
				<li>At this point, you're done.  Save the image in the desired format (e.g. as a RGB-formatted .bmp file).</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p>I haven't actually analyzed any monazites in the sample yet, but I made the image above to identify where to look for monazites.  I
			feel ok about my monazite analysis method, which puts the parent/daughter elements on the WDS detectors and the major elements on the
			EDS detector.  Unfortunately, there is what I suspect to be an absolute systematic error affecting the calculated ages based on a
			discrepancy relative to the random USGS reference material I found in the cabinet.  It would be good to get some more of these to make
			some kind of calibration curve for the ages (is that allowed?).</p>
			
			<h5>Outstanding questions:</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Analyze the monazites!  What's the process like?  What are the ages?</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>
