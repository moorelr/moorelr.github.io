			<h1>Bris-1 mystery sample</h1>
			
			<h4>Rev. 1/3/2023 LRM... A test case for microprobe method development for metamorphic petrology applications</h4>
			
			<p>Bris-1 is a random thin section that I found in the Petrology Lab when I started working as a lab manager.  At the time of 
			writing, I have no idea where it comes from.  So far, it's turned out to be a garnet-bearing metamorphic rock with a lot of quartz, 
			alkali feldspars, mica, cordierite, and kyanite.</p>
			
			<p><b>Note:</b> I use YYMMDD dates in my notes, and some of these dates may be floating around in here.</p>

			<p><b>Commentary:</b> If I were a good microprobe user, I would have photographed and scanned the sample before starting any analyses,
			but sometimes one is in a hurry and doesn't do that.  The PCA analyses, EDS analyses, and Ti-In-Qtz analyses were done before I went
			back to the Petrology lab to make the photo/scans.</p>

			<p><b>Commentary: </b>A big-picture problem I am interested in figuring out is how to obtain modal mineral abundances using X-ray maps.
			This problem has been solved previously with various image segmentation programs including <a href = "https://xmaptools.ch/">Pierre
			Lanari's XMapTools</a>, but that doesn't prevent me from being curious about strategies for image segmentation or other ways to make
			sense of multi-channel X-ray data.</p>
			
			<p>To get some preliminary X-ray data for the sample, I made a full thin section map using the following settings with the result
			shown below.  I think it was also my intent to use the thin section to test my monazite dating method, but I must have forgotten about
			this initially.</p>

					wiriting, the latter is my working policy.

			<p><b>Aside:</b> At some point, I'll probably need to explain what PCA is and how it's being used here.  Here are my notes about PCA:</p>
			
			<h5>Lowell's explanation of PCA</h5>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The goal of PCA is dimensionality reduction.  Suppose you have a dataset with many dimensions, but some of the variables are
				correlated. In this case, multiple variables can be summarized by simply considering a linear relationship between them.</li>
				<li>In geology, the use of various mineralogical indices calculated from more complete chemical analyses (e.g. Fo#, An#,
				Peralkalinity index) accomplishes the goal of dimensionality reduction, and is loosely analogous to PCA.</li>
				<li>PCA refers to a calculation that projects multidimensional data onto a new coordinate system.</li>
				<li>The axes in the coordinate system are mutually orthogonal, and each axis points in the direction of maximum variance.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>(the "mathy" bits)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The number of PCs is equal to the number of variables</li>
				<li>The PCs are unit vectors that constitute an orthonormal basis</li>
				<li>Note: an eigenvector is a vector "v" corresponding to a square matrix "A" such that the product A*v = lambda*v where
				the scalar "lambda" is the eigenvalue of eigenvector "v"</li>
				<li>Also note: a covariance matrix is an n x n matrix of n variables where each item in the matrix is the covariance of
				two corresponding variables of the variables.</li>
				<li>The PCs are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix.  PCA performs a change of basis calculation to transform the
				original data to be expressed eigenvalues of the PCs/eigenvectors/orthonormal unit vectors.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>(defining some of the jargon)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Loading (positive/negative): refers to the degree to which a variable contributes to or is correlated with a PC</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>Commentary:</b> PCA was done for the Bris-1 sample in R with the image made from PC's 1, 2, and 3 mapped onto the R, G, and B
			channels respectively.  The process of making the PCA image is extremely easy, but interpreting the colors/clusters as individual
			minerals and segmenting the image into the clusters is difficult.</p>
			
			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					231219 A photo of my printed-out-and-written-on notes from a session that I spent trying to "ground truth" the minerals that I had
					previously attempted to identify using my X-ray maps.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>After looking around with the EDS, here are the main takeaways (with colors in reference to the PCA image above):
			<ul>
				<li>The quartz, garnet, and ilmenite seem to have been identified correctly.</li>
				<li>I misidentified the feldspars: the lighter green phase is a Na-rich feldspar (~75% Albite), and the darker green phase is a
				K-rich feldspar (~90% Orthoclase).</li>
				<li>In the patchy red/orange/brown areas that I labeled as "Biotite?" several minerals are present:
				<ul>
					<li>Yellowish-brown = Kyanite</li>
					<li>Dark red = Cordierite</li>
					<li>Light pinkish-red = Biotite</li>
					<li>Darker maroon = <s>also biotite, containing Ti?</s> fine-grained kyanite + quartz</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Also, it seems like there could be two micas growing together: a more K-rich mica, and a more Fe+Ti-rich mica (biotite and
				muscovite?).</li>
				<li>The light pink/purple color seems to include both monazite and sulfides (pyrrhotite?) as well as ilmenite.</li>
				<li>The white phase marked as "Sulfides?" is actually apatite.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Segmentation</h3>
			<a href = "#contents">back to top</a>
			
			<p>Here's what I've tried so far with regards to segmentation:
			<ul>
				<li>K-means clustering EDS maps in ImageJ</li>
				<li>"Segmenting" images (to visualize potential clusters) using PCA in R + ImageJ</li>
				<li>K-means clustering EDS maps in R</li>
				<li>Naively segmenting BSE images using the "16 colors" LUT in ImageJ</li>
				<li>Staring at transmitted light photomicrographs wishing that the thin section would just segment itself</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>
			
			<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the K-means clustering approach, I need a way to "ground truth" the phase proportion, and
			I can't think of a better way to do this than point counting.  To count points, I wrote a basic R script (240102) to randomly display a
			100 x 100 pixel subregion of the PC image shown above, and used this to count ~120 points at the center of each sampled region.
			I then compared this result to the proportions of the clusters which are shown in the image above.</p>
			
			<p>Here is a table of the point counting results:</p>
			<table>
			<tr><th>phase_options</th>	<th>phase_props </th>	<th>n_counted</th>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Quartz</td>			<td>0.49</td>			<td>49</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>K-spar</td>			<td>0.18</td>			<td>18</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Na-Spar</td>		<td>0.05</td>			<td>5</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Garnet</td>			<td>0.12</td>			<td>12</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Biotite</td>		<td>0.05</td>			<td>5</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Kyanite</td>		<td>0.08</td>			<td>8</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Cordierite</td>		<td>0.02</td>			<td>2</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>Ilmenite</td>		<td>0</td>				<td>0</td>	</tr>
			<tr><td>unclear</td>		<td>0.01</td>			<td>1</td>	</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>Here is a table of the K-means clustering results:</p>
			<table>
			<tr><th>cluster_id</th>	<th>cluster_names</th>	<th>prop_clust </th>	<th>n_clust </th>	</tr>
			<tr><td>1</td>			<td>K-fsp</td>			<td>0.238427</td>		<td>393783</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>2</td>			<td>Crd+Bt+Ky</td>		<td>0.222723</td>		<td>367846</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>3</td>			<td>Na-Fsp</td>			<td>0.078168</td>		<td>129102</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>4</td>			<td>Qtz</td>			<td>0.352312</td>		<td>581874</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>5</td>			<td>Grt</td>			<td>0.098683</td>		<td>162984</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>6</td>			<td>none_6</td>			<td>0.000000</td>		<td>0</td>			</tr>
			<tr><td>7</td>			<td>phosphate</td>		<td>0.000455</td>		<td>751</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>8</td>			<td>none_8</td>			<td>0.000000</td>		<td>0</td>			</tr>
			<tr><td>9</td>			<td>Ilm+Sf</td>			<td>0.001321</td>		<td>2181</td>		</tr>
			<tr><td>10</td>			<td>Ilm+Sf2</td>		<td>0.007911</td>		<td>13066</td>		</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>...so not great, but not terrible?  My guess is that the proportion of quartz is being underestimated by the K-means clusters
			because the clustering algorithm can't separate fine-grained quartz that is intergrown with other stuff (e.g kyanite) from the
			big quartz grains.</p>

			<p><b>My notes about reporting uncertainty:</b></p>
			
			<p>Uncertainty is going to depend on these factors:
			<ul>
				<li>Counting statistics (more X-ray counts per second means more precision)</li>
				<li>Quality of standards (are the reported concentrations accurate? are the standards homogeneous?)</li>
				<li>Instrumental drift (were there any big temperature swings in the lab?)</li>
				<li>User error and sample preparation (were any mistakes made preparing the sample, applying a conductive
				C coating, doing the calibration, or performing the analyses?)</li>
			</ul>
			If we assume that everything went well and no mistakes were made, then it's fine to use the calculated uncertainties returned
			by the software which are based on X-ray counting statistics.  As one can imagine this assumption isn't always valid,
			and that's why I usually suggest that users analyze several replicates of different reference materials (calibration standards,
			our set of SI microbeam standards, etc.) as unknowns during their analytical session.
			</p>

			<p>What I would recommend is that if some of the standards were analysed in replicate as unknowns, then the user could say something like
			"uncertainty was estimated based on the standard deviation of N replicate analyses of [a diopside standard (or whatever)]
			provided by the microprobe lab."  Alternatively, if this wasn't done, or if the user feels like there weren't any major problems
			based on periodically analyzing one of the standards as an unknown, then the user can just report the errors from counting statistics.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<p>To check the precision/accuracy of the quantitative method, I analyzed a bunch of replicates of some of my reference materials
			to create calibration-curve-like plots and calculate a regression line and uncertainty envelope.  It seems like this is probably
			the most robust way to estimate all of the sources of uncertainty including user error and quality of the standards.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p><b>Commentary:</b> most users are unsure about the best conditions to use for mapping trace elements.  Usually the trace element in
			question is Yttrium, and the material in question is garnet.  Ideally, I should be able to provide a general way for the user to figure
			this out independently without wasting a bunch of time trying things randomly, and collecting a few "qualitative" WDS spectra to test
			out different spectrometer/element pairings, dwell times, and beam conditions seems like the best way to do this.  I've written about
			this process elsewhere.</p>
			
			<p>The figure above shows the results of a basic test that I did, which basically determined -- without making any maps ahead of
			time -- that mapping Y, Ti, Sc, and Cr would be a waste of time for this garnet for the amount of time that I was prepared to spend
