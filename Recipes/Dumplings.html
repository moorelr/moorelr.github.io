			<h1>Nanxi's Dumpling Recipe</h1>
			<h4>Rev. 10/9/2022 LRM.</h4>
			<p><i>
				Recipe learned from a friend back in ~2013 back when we had more Chinese friends at VT.  Had a great time manufacturing dumplings
				for Chinese New Year a few times, and we eventually got a personalized tutorial in our apartment.  Makes about 50 dumplings.
			</i></p>
			
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Flour -- 2 c. wheat flour</li>
				<li>Meat -- 1 lb ground meat</li>
				<li>Green onion -- 1 bunch of frech green onion, minced</li>
				<li>Ginger -- 1/4 c. frech ginger, minced</li>
				<li>Sichuan peppercorn -- 1 tbsp dry peppercorns (a.k.a. "Prickly ash seeds")</li>
				<li>Soy sauce -- 1/4 c. medium soy sauce</li>
				<li>Cabbage -- 1 whole Napa cabbage, minced</li>
				<li>Cooking wine -- Chinese yellow cooking wine, 1/4 c (substitute boxed Chardonnay)</li>
				<li>Chicken powder -- 1 tbsp (a.k.a. "Caldo de Pollo")</li>
				<li>Sugar -- 1 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
				<li>Sesame oil -- 1/4 c.</li>
				<li>Salt -- ~1/4 c.</li>
				<li>Chinese 13 spice mix -- It comes in a little yellow box with a brown picture of a chinese guy wearing a hat.  You can buy it at Oasis.  Or substitute a five-spice mix.  Or omit it entirely.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			
			<h3>Dough for wrapppers</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Add flour to mixing bowl, and slowly mix in warm water until the dough comes together.</li>
				<li>Knead thoroughly.</li>
				<li>Leave dough to sit covered in plastic wrap for 1 hour or until dumpling filling is ready</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Dumpling filling</h3>
			
			<p><i>
				Note: Three things happen in parallel here: boiling pricklyash seeds, dry brining cabbage, and blending meat. Everything eventually is added to the meat bowl or discarded.
			</i></p>
			
			<p><i>
				Note: For best results, make a day early, and refrigerate overnight.
			</i></p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Add 1/3 cup of water to a small skillet, and bring to a boil.</li>
				<li>Add Prickly ash seeds, and boil for 5 minutes</li>
				<li>Add cabbage in a big bowl and cover with a thin layer of salt. This will start pulling the water out of the cabbage, and it will become slightly fragrant.</li>
				<li>Add meat to the bowl, and stir thoroughly (four chopsticks work well).</li>
				<li>Stir in cooking wine.</li>
				<li>Stir salt into cabbage, and squeeze out the water, reserving about 1 cup cabbage water. Do this periodically, and continue adding salt as necessary to get the water out.</li>
				<li>Pour off water from pricklyash seeds into the meat.</li>
				<li>Squeeze out ~1/2 cup of water from cabbage and add to meat. Add additional cabbage water if the meat gets too dry: it should have a consistency similar to peanut butter.</li>
				<li>Squeeze out cabbage very thoroughly so that it is as dry as possible.</li>
				<li>Add cabbage to meat. Add soy sauce to meat. It should look dark and smell noticeably like salt and soy sauce, and be sticky.</li>
				<li>Add garlic, ginger, green onion, spices, sugar, and sesame oil, and mix thoroughly.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Dumpling wrappers</h3>
			
			<ol>
			<li>Flour hands and working surface.</li>
			<li>Roll dough into a balland divide into thirds.</li>
			<li>Roll dough into tubes with ~1 inch diameter.</li>
			<li>For each dumpling:
				<ol>
					<li>Tear off 1-inch-long piece and roll it into a ball.</li>
					<li>Press ball flat with palm of hand.</li>
					<li>Using a rolling pin, roll outward from the middle while simultaneously rotating (the finished wrapper should be slightly thicker in the middle compared to the edges.</li>
					<li>Add filling, and fold closed.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Bring pan of water to a rolling boil.</li>
					<li>Drop dumplings in to boil(no more than will fit floating on the surface of the water).</li>
					<li>Dumplings are almost cooked when they float (wait two minutes more).</li>
					<li>Remove pan from heat: if dumplings still float when the water is not boiling, then they are done</li>
				</ol>
				
			<h3>Extra notes</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>I only used about half of a big Napa cabage from oasis.  Next time double recipe except for cabbage?</li>
					<li>I found that two batches of wrapper dough with 300g flour + 150g water was about perfect to use up all of the filling and have a good-performing wrapper (~18 dumplings each).</li>
					<li>Leftover filling can be consumed with a small batch of wrappers weighed out to the appropriate (very small) amount using the appropriate hydration ratio.</li>
					<li>Note: % hydration = 100*liquid mass/flour mass</li>
					<li>for 300g of flour, 150g of water was almost too soft (50% hydration), and ~120 to ~130g was a bit too firm (40-43% hydration)</li>
					<li>Wetting the edges of the wrappers is totally unnecessary</li>
					<li>Prepare one small baking pan in top part of kitchen freezer with parchment paper, and a larger pan in the basement freeser.  Also prepare space in the basement freezer for a bag to fill with dumplings.</li>
					<li>Working solo, wrappers and dumplings can be made in series using a small cereal bowl with a damp dish cloth to hold wrapperr dough and small dough balls.</li>
					<li>Prepare small area to dredge wrappers in flour so they don't stick. Only make about 1/3 of the wrappers in each batch (i.e. 1/6 of total wrappers) at a time</li>
					<li>Loosen and warm small dough balls in hand by squishing.</li>
					<li>Press 4 times with palm</li>
					<li>Roll 4x rotating 90 degrees</li>
					<li>Roll ~6x toward edges from middle</li>
					<li>Add filling: maybe ~40% of wrapper diameter?</li>
					<li>stretch and use three fingers on each side to seal middle and each end.</li>
					<li>Twist and shear edges to crimp closed.</li>
					<li>Store on plate as you make them, then transfer to upstairs freezer and then downstairs freezer, and then bag.</li>
					<li>Dumplings can also be cooked in a steamer basket lined with a hankie for 15-20 minutes.</li>
					<li><i>DO NOT MAKE ENORMOUS DUMPLINGS</i> -- they will take longer to steam.</li>
