			<h1>Feta pasta bake</h1>
			<h4>Rev. 5/29/2022 LRM.</h4>
			<p><i>Found this looking for a "dairy-free" (i.e. no cow!) substitute for my typical cheesey meaty bake. Apparently the original recipe (as opposed to my modified version) has been going viral, and it did not disappoint! 
			<br>Modified from <a href = "https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35421563/baked-feta-pasta-tiktok/">https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a35421563/baked-feta-pasta-tiktok/</a></i>
