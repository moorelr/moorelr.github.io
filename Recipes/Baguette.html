			<h1>Baguette</h1>
			<h4>Rev. 10/9/2022 LRM.</h4>
			
			<p><i>Until October 2022 I had been using a crappy "French Bread" recipe that I found on YouTube when I was an undergraduate student.  
			This recipe did not emphasize shaping the dough and overemphasized rising and kneading which led me to make many dense, flat loaves of bread.
			After a little more research I learned that stretching and molding the loaves after the first rise is really important.  Now I think I can
			consistently make something on par with the baguettes they sell at Kroger, which is good ennough for me!</i></p>
			
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Flour -- 2 cups of all-purpose flour (300 g)</li>
				<li>Wheat gluten -- 2 tsp (one tsp per cup if not using bread flour)</li>
				<li>Salt -- 1-2 tsp</li>
				<li>Yeast -- 2 tsp of dry yeast</li>
				<li>Water -- 1 c of cold tap water (or whatever weight corresponds to 70% hydration relative to all dry ingredients)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Note: I have been using the kind of dry yeast that you don't have to proof.  When this is not the case, the best way to modift the recipe would
			probably to be to proof the yeast with warm water + sugar, and then add this with the water after whisking together dry ingredients.</p>
			
			<p>Also, have these on hand:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Kettle of water ready to boil</li>
				<li>Mixing bowl and silicone spatula</li>
				<li>1 dry dish towel + 1 damp dish towel</li>
				<li>Baking pan + parchment paper (or corn meal)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Whisk together dry ingredients, then add water</li>
				<li>Stir until dough separates from bowl</li>
				<li>Turn out onto floured surface, flour hands, and fold dough until fully uniform</li>
				<li>Clean out bowl and spatula and allow dough to rest for a couple of minutes</li>
				<li>Fold dough into a ball (similar to pita bread process), and place folded side down in the bowl</li>
				<li>Heat oven to 150°F, and place bowl with dough inside covered with damp dish towel</li>
				<li>Allow ~1 hour for dough to rise and double in size</li>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Turn out dough onto a floured surface with a (floured?) silicone spatula</li>
				<li>Divide dough ball in half, and perform the folowing steps for each loaf.</li>
				<li>Gently flatten each loaf into a rectangle (~1-2 inches thick)</li>
				<li>Stretch/roll each loaf into a long cylinder, and tuck in the ends so all the folded parts are facing down.</li>
				<li>Transfer the loaves onto a floured dry dish towel and arrange them so they are held up by each other (separated by a fold in the
				towel) and the edge of a baking pan/the turned over side of the dish cloth.  The goal is to support the sides of the loaves so they
				don't form flat.</li>
				<li>Cut the tops of the loaves with a razor blade or scissors, and allow ~1 hour to rise.</li>
				<br>
				<br>
				<li>Preheat oven to 450°F with a pan inside to hold the water, and boil a kettle of water</li>
				<li>When the oven is hot, transfer the loaves onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (or corn meal), and re-boil the kettle if necessary</li>
				<li>Add the baking sheet to the oven, and pour the boiling water onto the pan (to create steam/humidity)</li>
				<li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, and remove loaves when they appear golden brown.</li>
				<li>For future reference, press down on the loaves and see if they make a nice crunchy sound.  Serve hot with butter... or whatever.</li>
